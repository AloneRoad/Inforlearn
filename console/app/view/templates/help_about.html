    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        App Engine Console
        is a tool to aid development on Google App Engine. It is a traditional
        interactive Python session running in the server, which you use from a web browser.  It
        is designed to be embedded within other applications to allow convenient testing, debugging,
        and maintenance.  App Engine Console has the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser-based console</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Just like running Python interactively from the command line</li>
                <li>Direct access to your application's run-time code and data</li>
                <li>Optional syntax highlighting</li>
                <li>Exceptions, modules, and types link to their own documentation on python.org</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Convenience</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatically imports an <tt>autoexec.py</tt> module to which you can add
                    your own code, then run it from the console</li>
                <li>Quick access to the datastore, application dashboard, and Google Analytics</li>
                <li>Pastebin integration</li>
                <li>Instant messaging between team members</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Only site administrators may use the console when in production</li>
                <li>Optionally return HTTP 404 to non-authorized users ("cloaked mode")</li>
                <li>Logs the email address, statements, and output of all activity</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
